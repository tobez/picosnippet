The picosnippet() function provides very simple and easy
to use HTML/DOM templating capabilities.

It does not use any sort of special templating syntax -
the template can be any valid HTML element.  The data,
represented by JavaScript associative arrays, are spliced
into a copy of the template using simple, consistent,
and easy to remember rules.

This allows the user to completely separate the HTML
markup from the application JavaScript logic without
using complicated libraries.

For details, please see documentation supplied with the
distribution, or visit http://www.tobez.org/picosnippet/ .

Please report any bugs and address any comments or feature
requests to tobez@tobez.org.

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
---------------------

The picosnippet() function has been tested and is known to fully
work with:

	- Chrome 5.0.375.86 (Linux)
	- Chrome 5.0.375.70 (Mac OS X)
	- Chrome 5.0.375.70 (Windows)
	- firefox 3.6.4 (FreeBSD)
	- firefox 3.5.9 (Linux)
	- firefox 3.6.3 (Max OS X)
	- firefox 3.6 (Windows)
	- opera 9.80 (FreeBSD)
	- opera 9.80 (Linux)
	- opera 10.51, 10.54 (Windows)
	- Safari 5.0 (Mac OS X)

It mostly works with IE 7.0 and 8.0 on Windows, except when
templating tables.  The workaround is being developed.

It is very likely that the picosnippet() function will work with
other versions of those browsers (except for old versions of IE),
even though it has not been tested with them.
