The picosnippet() function provides very simple and easy
to use HTML/DOM templating capabilities.

It does not use any sort of special templating syntax -
the template can be any valid HTML element.  The data,
represented by JavaScript associative arrays, are spliced
into a copy of the template using simple, consistent,
and easy to remember rules.

This allows the user to completely separate the HTML
markup from the application JavaScript logic without
using complicated libraries.

For details, please see documentation supplied with the
distribution, or visit http://www.tobez.org/picosnippet/ .

Please report any bugs and address any comments or feature
requests to tobez@tobez.org.

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
---------------------

The picosnippet() function has been tested and is known to fully
work with:

	- Chrome 6.0.472.63 (Windows)
	- Chrome 6.0.472.63 (Linux)
	- firefox 3.6.10 (FreeBSD)
	- firefox 3.6.10 (Linux)
	- firefox 3.6 (Windows)
	- opera 10.61 (FreeBSD)
	- opera 10.62 (Linux)
	- Safari (iOS 4.1)
	- IE 7.0.5730.13 (Windows)
	- IE 8.0.6001.18702 (Windows)

It is very likely that the picosnippet() function will work with other
versions of those browsers (except for old versions of IE, which are
hereby declared not supported), even though it has not been tested with them.
